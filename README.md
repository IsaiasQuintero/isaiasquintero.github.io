Assignment 2 instructions:

    The goal of this assignment is to create a dynamic HTML webpage that
    visually responds to the time of day by changing its background color. 
    Students will design the page using HTML and JavaScript, 
    then deploy it to a publicly accessible hosting platform.

Expanded on the webpage, adding javascript to the index.html itself

Functionality:
- HTML page displays information
- Background color changes depending on time of day

Known issues:
- The javascript is currently local, but if it gets more complex, it would be useful to have it 
in an external file dedicated to the Javascript.

Source code files:
- index.html (main and sole file at the moment)
